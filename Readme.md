There is no documentation at the moment other than doc for the base of the code https://github.com/generaxion/axio-starter + https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light

wp-content/plugins - you would get an idea about the stack
wp-content/plugins/x-core a copy of https://github.com/generaxion/axio-core
wp-content/plugins/x-ui-library purely written by me this what I call it core UI for now but the path is long because of dependencies management and that summer is approaching and weekends are for going to the beach
wp-content/themes/x based on https://github.com/generaxion/axio-starter


Also I was able to explore writing a package to transform json tokens to other languages for now scss + php and the output is simple as what I needed on the project to move forward https://bitbucket.org/gk-git/gulp-json-data-to-sass/src/master/index.js

choose axio-starter for the pure reason that I used it for a single page website back in 2020 when I like the modular approach that they take

the philosophy behind this is primary - moving https://gabykaram.com/ to wordpress and doing thing differently
